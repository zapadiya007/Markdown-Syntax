# Paragraphs
    To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

# Line Breaks
    To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.
    Example : 
        jkjsjfjkjfkjs1  
        djskjjffjjfjdkjf2  
        ckjkfjsdfjlksdjglk3  
        dhjd

# Emphasis

Bold

    To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. 
    To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.
    Example :
            I just love **bold text**.
            I just love __bold text__.
            Love**is**bold

Italic

    To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. 
    To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.
    Example :
            I just love *bold text*.
            I just love _bold text_.
            Love*is*bold

Bold and Italic 

    To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. 
    To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.
    Example :
            This text is ***really important***.
            This text is ___really important___.
            This is really***very***important text.

# Blockquotes  
    To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
    Example :
            > Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

    Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs :
    Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs
    Example :
            > Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
            >
            > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

    Nested Blockquotes : 
    Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.
    Example :
            > Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
            >
            >> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

    Blockquotes with Other Elements :
    Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.
    Example : 
            > #### The quarterly results look great!
            >
            > - Revenue was off the chart.
            > - Profits were higher than ever.
            >
            >  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
